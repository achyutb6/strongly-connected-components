# strongly-connected-components

   Implement the algorithm to find strongly connected components of a directed graph.
   Add the method to your DFS class from SP8.  Make changes so that all methods share
   as much of the code as possible.

   ```sh
   public static DFS stronglyConnectedComponents(Graph g) { ... }
   ```
